To compile the Program you need version 7 of jdk (or higher). If you have it, just write in the src directory:
javac *.java

To run it, you have to create the tree as it is in the
sikla/ folder.
This means:


sikla/
	SiklaMain.class
	GamePanel.class
	StageCreator.class
	FileManager.class
	stages
	
	profiles/	(empty folder)
	data/
		
		block.png
		goal.png
		wall.png
		sikla.png
		restart.png
		next.gif
		previous.dif

Of course, you must have also jre of version 7 (or anyway >= than the jdk which you compiled with).
