It has only 10 stages for now...


TO INSTALL ON LINUX:

1. Download the zip file, extract it, and go to the Linux_Install folder.
2. Then double-click the file install_sikla and excecute it.
If it just opens in the text editor, you should right-click it, go to properties, and find the checkbox
"Allow to excecute as a program" and mark it.

If you like terminal more, just cd to the Linux_Install folder and type
make


 3. A file named Sikla will appear to your home folder. Double-click it to play!
You can move this file wherever you like.

That's all, have fun :-)
